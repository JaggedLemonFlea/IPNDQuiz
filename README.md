# IPNDQuiz by Steve Brylka
This is my Intro To Programming "Code Your Own Quiz" project.
It is a quiz about the band Tool.

One thing to note, it does fall outside of the project rubric in one aspect:  Functions should be 18 lines or less.

This is because of the way I wanted the users to experience and interact with the program.  Rather than just having the text fill up the screen and scroll up, I wanted each "page" to be fresh so that each time the user answered correctly the screen would clear and reprint the updated text at the top of the terminal window.  To do this I used a couple calls to a function I created to clear the screen.  Without these few extra function calls the code would be under 18 lines.
